### Overview

This repository provides a tool to easily propagate the "use" permission of the listed instance groups within organizations to administrators or users of the organization. It addresses the need to ensure that the "use" permission for instance groups is managed by dedicated teams. This tool replicates the behavior of "use" permission for organization administrators introduced in AWX (https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/4292), serving as a workaround until the official solution is available (https://github.com/ansible/awx/issues/14564).

### Features

- Manage "use" permission for instance groups within organizations.
- Replicate the behavior of "use" permission for organization administrators in AWX.
- Work as a temporary workaround until the official solution is available in AWX.


## Usage


1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youtous/awx-ig-org-sync.git
```

2. Run the script, providing your controller's OAuth2 token and URL:

```bash 
python main.py --controller-oauth2-token="******************" --controller-url=https://1.1.1.2
```

You can also schedule this script to enable regular synchronization of the permissions.
